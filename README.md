# 20 Mini Webapps
## 20 mini webapps comprised of modern vanilla javascript concepts (no frameworks or libraries), with the help of a few javascript APIs.
### Each project has its own branch so to go to a particular project select the corresponding branch

#### I changed the index file extension from ".html" to ".php" so that I could import my private API key from a hidden "config.php" file. This project is still primarily html, css and javascript, aside from a few lines of php. Please see "setup.txt" file for additional details on how to properly set up this project after downloading the code.
