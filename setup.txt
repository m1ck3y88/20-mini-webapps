// This project is strictly an html, css and javascript project.
// However, the API that I used now requires for you to sign up 
// for a private API key.
// Therefore, to make things easier, I just changed the index 
// file from an html file into a php file. That way, I could  
// store my private API key into a php variable located in a 
// seperate config.php file.
// See setup below:


/* // Create php variable for private API key
// In seprate config.php file
$apiKey = "<your API Key>"; // minus the angle brackets

// Make sure to include or require your config.php file at the
// Very top of your index.php file before all HTML code like so:
<?php
  require 'config.php';
?>

// Store the php variable in a javascript variable as a string
const apiKey = "<?php echo $apiKey; ?>";

// Now you can use the javacript variable, containing the php
// Variable, directly in an HTML template string like so:

fetch(`https://someapiendpoint.com/${apiKey}`) //example site
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => {
        console.log(data);
    });

// Remember that all php and javascript code needs to be
// Embedded into your HTML, just like in this project, in
// Order to work */
